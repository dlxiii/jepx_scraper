# jepx_scraper

This project downloads spot market data from the JEPX website using Playwright.

## Installation

Install Python dependencies and the Playwright browsers:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

## Usage

Run the helper script with a date in `YYYY/MM/DD` format. CSV files are placed under `csv/<YEAR>/` based on the year of the date.

```bash
python run_jepx_curve.py 2025/04/24
```

## Data storage

The repository includes a `csv/` directory containing roughly 1.4Â GB of historical CSV files. If you plan to store more data, consider using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or another external storage option instead of committing large files directly to Git.

## Scheduled scraping

The repository contains a workflow file at `.github/workflows/jepx.yml` that runs daily and uploads the latest CSV files as artifacts. When you fork the project, GitHub disables workflows by default. To activate the schedule, open the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository and click **Enable workflows**.
